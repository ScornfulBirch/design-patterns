# Structural Design Patterns

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures
flexible and efficient.

### [Adapter](https://github.com/ScornfulBirch/design-patterns/blob/master/src/structural/Adapter.kt)

Allow objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

### [Bridge](https://github.com/ScornfulBirch/design-patterns/blob/master/src/structural/Bridge.kt)

Lets you split a large class, or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and
implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.
Composite
### [Composite](https://github.com/ScornfulBirch/design-patterns/blob/master/src/structural/Composite.kt)

Lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

### [Decorator](https://github.com/ScornfulBirch/design-patterns/blob/master/src/structural/Decorator.kt)

Lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the
behaviors.

### [Facade](https://github.com/ScornfulBirch/design-patterns/blob/master/src/structural/Facade.kt)

Provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

### [Flyweight](https://github.com/ScornfulBirch/design-patterns/blob/master/src/structural/Flyweight.kt)

Lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects
instead of keeping all of the data in each object.

### [Proxy](https://github.com/ScornfulBirch/design-patterns/blob/master/src/structural/Proxy.kt)

Lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object,
allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.
